# Project Title:
Diabetes prediction

# Description:
The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether a person will have or has diabetes. Additionally, the project will study the causes and factors that could lead to the development of the disease. This will be achieved through an in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand step-by-step which features are important and provide the most information to achieve our objective.

# Data Acquisition:
This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. The download link and column explanations are available and well-detailed within the project. The data are real and were collected in 1990 from a population consisting entirely of women aged 21 and over.

# Final Model Performance for the Project:
The final model performance is completely balanced, as I focused on selecting the necessary features for training the model and understanding the importance of the initial data imbalance. Everything is explained in detail within the project. The final conclusions are based on the context and nature of this data and do not aim to replace or supplant high-tier scientific studies on diabetes.
